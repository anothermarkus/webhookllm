        //         "‚Ä¢ **Repetitive Component Usage**: Avoid duplicating the same components multiple times in a template with only slight variations. If the same component is rendered with different conditions or input bindings (e.g., *ngIf), it's often a sign of duplication. Consider using *ngFor with a data structure to dynamically render components instead of repeating them manually.\n" +
        //         //"‚Ä¢ **Improper Use of ngIf vs ngFor**: Don't use *ngIf when *ngFor should be used. *ngIf is designed to conditionally render a single element, while *ngFor should be used when rendering multiple items from an array or iterable. If you have multiple similar elements that could be dynamically created from an array, replace *ngIf with *ngFor.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Improper Use of ngIf**\n\n**Definition**: Multiple elements are rendered conditionally using *ngIf with similar structure. Consider replacing these with a single *ngFor loop over an array. Do not call methods like computeList() directly in templates.\n"+
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Change Detection Issues**: Be mindful of Angular's change detection strategy. Avoid writing complex logic directly in templates that could lead to performance issues (e.g., expensive calculations or function calls). Instead, move these calculations into the component class and use memoization or `trackBy` functions to optimize performance.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Excessive Component Nesting**: Avoid deep component hierarchies. Too much nesting can lead to performance issues and hard-to-maintain code. Break down large components into smaller, reusable, and more manageable ones.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Template-Driven Forms Overuse**: Avoid using template-driven forms for complex form logic. For more complex forms, prefer reactive forms, as they provide better control, scalability, and testability. Template-driven forms are more suited for simpler, static forms.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Lack of Lazy Loading**: Failing to implement lazy loading can result in unnecessarily large initial payloads for the application. Use Angular's lazy loading feature to split the application into smaller chunks that are only loaded when needed, reducing the initial loading time.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Hardcoding Data in Templates**: Avoid hardcoding dynamic data directly in the template. For example, avoid binding UI elements to data that‚Äôs not coming from the component or service. Always aim to keep the logic and data in the component class for better maintainability and testability.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Inefficient Event Binding**: Be cautious about binding events within loops or repeated elements. This can result in unnecessary function calls and decreased performance. Instead, optimize by binding the event handler at the component level and using `$event` to access specific data.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Improper Use of Observables**: Avoid unnecessary subscriptions or subscriptions without proper cleanup. Ensure that Observables are unsubscribed properly, especially in components where the lifecycle is tied to DOM changes, to prevent memory leaks. Prefer using the `async` pipe in templates or use `takeUntil` in component code to handle subscriptions.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Memory Leaks Due to Subscriptions**: In Angular, it's crucial to unsubscribe from any subscriptions when a component is destroyed. If you're subscribing to the store or observables manually (e.g., via `store.select()` or `observable.subscribe()`), ensure you unsubscribe to avoid memory leaks. Use `takeUntil` with a `Subject` to handle cleanup on component destruction, or use the `async` pipe to manage subscriptions automatically in the template.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Using Services to Store State**: When using NgRx, avoid storing component state within services for cross-component state sharing. Instead, rely on the store to manage application state. Using the store keeps state management predictable, traceable, and scalable. Components should subscribe to the store directly to receive state updates, rather than holding state in services that need to be referenced later.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Mismanagement of Services and Singletons**: Avoid creating services inside components. Services should be injected via dependency injection and should be provided at the appropriate level (root or module) to avoid multiple instances and ensure proper singleton behavior.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Improper Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling in your services and components, especially for HTTP requests. Use `.catchError()` or `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors and provide fallback logic or user-friendly messages when needed.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Avoid direct DOM manipulation using `document.getElementById()` or other native JavaScript DOM APIs. Instead, rely on Angular‚Äôs built-in mechanisms like directives or `Renderer2` to manipulate the DOM safely and efficiently, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.\n" +
        //         "‚Ä¢ **Excessive use of Local Storage or Session Storage**: Be careful when using local storage or session storage for data persistence in Angular. Sensitive data should never be stored in the browser storage without encryption, and reliance on storage should be minimized to ensure proper application performance and security.\n" +
